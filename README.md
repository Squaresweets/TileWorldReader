# TileWorldReader
![Wallpaper](https://github.com/Squaresweets/TileWorldReader/blob/main/Wallpaper.png)
A small python project to make a png out of a [tileworld](https://tileworld.org) backup such as [this one](https://tileworld.org/world2.zip)

Extract the files and input the directory into the program, image size can be changed by changing the variables **chunkSizeX** and **chunkSizeY**

A few examples of images I have made can be found in this project aswell as the actual code, the one I am most proud is [this one](https://matthewcollier.co.uk/TileWorldMap.png)

Enjoy :D
